<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://res.cloudinary.com/dbnapmpvm/image/upload/v1644355343/Portfolio/B20BA202-D475-4A70-BA39-0AB6D487942C_wc10qv.jpg)

Coach console provides a tool for fitness coaches to log a large amount of varying information about their clients' and see how it changes over time. After signing up or logging in, coaches reach a dashboard containing all of their clients. Each particular client has their own page where data about their exercise, body fat percentage, calorie expendature and so on is displayed in chart form by date. New "check in's" can be added to the client to add to the data as a whole. Each check in can be viewed along side the previous one for more short term data comparison.
<br />

Coach console includes the following features:

<ul>
 <li>Login/Signup with encrypted password
 <li>Create/Delete clients
 <ul>Create new checkins which include
    <li>Age
    <li>Weight
    <li>Date
    <li>Caliper Measurements
    <li>Tape Measurements
    <li>Progress Photos
    <li>Cardio Activity
    <li>Calories Burned
 </ul>
 <li>Editing or deleting checkins
 <li>Graph display of data from checkins beginning to most recent checkin
 <li>Viewable chack in's compareed to previous check in
 <li>Display of total weight/body fat change over time
</ul>
